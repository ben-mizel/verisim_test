## Tools
 -python
 -sqlite3
 -flask

## Done
 - Application was created in a virtual env (verisim)
 - database was set up
 - application runs on localhost:5000
 - basic front end was setup to enter drug information
 - post functionality was defined
 - read functionality was defined
 
 ## Still To Do
 - Edit functionality
 - update functionality


 ## stretch
  - Revisit database schema. I know some of the drug attributes will exhibit a one to many relationship, so table will need to be normalized.
